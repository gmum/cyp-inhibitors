# Generation of new inhibitors of selected cytochrome P450 subtypes â€“ in silico study

## Data

The poses of docked compounds are available in the `data/poses` directory. For each generated compound, its best scoring pose is saved in the mol2 data format.

In the `data/crystals` directory, there is a set of pre-processed pdb files containing CYP structures used for docking. The binding pocket centers are described in the corresponding yaml files.
